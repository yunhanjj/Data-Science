Even till this date, almost two years later, its impact has not diminished. Our study aims to investigate the health, economic, and political impact of COVID-19 in various countries around the world, in addition to a comprehensive study on all states within the United States. This project draws data from COVID-19 Open Dataset, which contains aggregated data tables from sources such as Wikidata, DataCommons, Eurostat, WorldBank, WorldPop, LawAtlas Project, University of Oxford, Google LLC, and etc. We decided to use this dataset as it only aggregated data without cleaning or processing the data from the original sources, and it clearly indicates the sources and licences for all data points in every single table we use. Having these data, this project aims to investigate the following questions: How much is economy affected by the rise of COVID-19 in different countries? Has government interventions been effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19? Are regions with good health records more resistant to the COVID-19 spread? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide visualization and insights from our data.

From the above data source, we collected and used six datasets: Economic indicators by countries, Covid-19 cases records, government emergency declarations, health indicators by regions, movement of people, and population vaccination records. Furthermore, we used an index data table which contains references to id/keys from other tables. 2.1 Economic Indicators by countries Dataset: economy.csv The economy dataset is consisted of 365 rows with 4 columns, as described below. Each row corresponds to a country. This dataset mainly describes important ecocnomic indicators associated with each country. Schema Name Name Description Example key string Unique string identifying the region US gdp integer [USD] Gross domestic product; monetary value of all finished goods and services 24450604878 gdp_per_capita integer [USD] Gross domestic product divided by total population 1148 human_capital_index double [0-1] Mobilization of the economic and professional potential of citizens 0.765 Sources of data Show data sources Data Source License and Terms of Use Metadata Wikipedia Terms of Use Metadata Eurostat CC BY Economy Wikidata CC0 Economy DataCommons Attribution required Economy WorldBank CC BY 2.2 Covid-19 cases records Dataset: epidemiology.csv The epidemiology dataset is fairly large. It consists of 9517268 rows with 10 columns, as described below. This dataset is time-series, with dates associated with each country/region. The major information includes newly confirmed, deceased, tested number of individuals with COVID-19 as well as the cumulative amounts for each category. Schema Name Type Description Example date string ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the datapoint 2020-03-30 key string Unique string identifying the region CN_HB new_confirmed1 integer Count of new cases confirmed after positive test on this date 34 new_deceased1 integer Count of new deaths from a positive COVID-19 case on this date 2 new_recovered1 integer Count of new recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case on this date 13 new_tested2 integer Count of new COVID-19 tests performed on this date 13 cumulative_confirmed3 integer Cumulative sum of cases confirmed after positive test to date 6447 cumulative_deceased3 integer Cumulative sum of deaths from a positive COVID-19 case to date 133 cumulative_recovered3 integer Cumulative sum of recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case to date 133 cumulative_tested2,3 integer Cumulative sum of COVID-19 tests performed to date 133 1Values can be negative, typically indicating a correction or an adjustment in the way they were measured. For example, a case might have been incorrectly flagged as recovered one date so it will be subtracted from the following date. 2Some health authorities only report PCR testing. This variable usually refers to cumulative number of tests and not tested persons, but some health authorities only report tested persons. 3Cumulative count will not always amount to the sum of daily counts, because many authorities make changes to criteria for counting cases, but not always make adjustments to the data. There is also potential missing data. All of that makes the cumulative counts drift away from the sum of all daily counts over time, which is why the cumulative values, if reported, are kept in a separate column.

Detailed code can be access here: data transformation notebook 3.1 Epidemiology Table For the epidemiology data, the raw data is consist of both country level and US state level datapoints. So we divided it into two tables, one for global country level and the other for the US state level, and we keep only the most relevant columns. The preprocessing steps is as following: Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. Select columns: date, location_key, new_confirmed, new_deceased, cumulative_confirmed, cumulative_deceased After cleaning, the country-level table has 163609 rows and 6 columns while the state-level table has 38537 rows and 6 columns.

We extracted only the same set of countries as in other tables to keep consistency across tables. The resulting table has 203 rows and three columns. ## # A tibble: 202 × 4 ## location_key country_name gdp_usd gdp_per_capita_usd ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 AD Andorra 3154057987 40886 ## 2 AE United Arab Emirates 421142267937 43103 ## 3 AF Afghanistan 19101353832 502 ## 4 AG Antigua and Barbuda 1727759259 17790 ## 5 AL Albania 15278077446 5352 ## 6 AM Armenia 13672802157 4622 ## 7 AO Angola 94635415869 2973 ## 8 AR Argentina 449663446954 10006 ## 9 AS American Samoa 636000000 11466 ## 10 AT Austria 455140042000 51448 ## # … with 192 more rows Description of each column is as following (The country-level and the state-level table has the same structure): Column Description location_key The code corresponding to the country gdp_usd Gross domestic product of the country in US dollars gdp_per_capita_usd Gross domestic product of the country in US dollars divided by its total population 3.3 First Mitigation Date Table The raw data are a table recording the mitigation policies and emergency declarations status of each state in the US. We derive the date that the first mitigation policy is published in each state from the raw data and formulate a new table of 51 rows and 2 columns. ## # A tibble: 51 × 3 ## location_key state_name first_mitigate_date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 US_AK Alaska 2020-03-09 ## 2 US_AL Alabama 2020-03-13 ## 3 US_AR Arkansas 2020-03-11 ## 4 US_AZ Arizona 2020-03-11 ## 5 US_CA California 2020-03-04 ## 6 US_CO Colorado 2020-03-11 ## 7 US_CT Connecticut 2020-03-10 ## 8 US_DC District of Columbia 2020-03-11 ## 9 US_DE Delaware 2020-03-13 ## 10 US_FL Florida 2020-03-01 ## # … with 41 more rows Description of each column is as following: Column Description state_code The code corresponding to the state (e.g. US_CA) first_mitigate_date the date that the first mitigation policy is published in the state 3.4 Health Table The raw data give several health indicators such as smoke prevalence in different regions. As country-level and state-level information are mixed together in the raw data, we need to separate them into two tables. Preprocessing steps: Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; if it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. As the state-level information only contains one health indicator, life_expectancy, and all other columns are all NAs. Country-level table: ## # A tibble: 210 × 15 ## location_key country_name life_expectancy smoking_prevale… diabetes_preval… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 AD Andorra NA 33.5 7.7 ## 2 AE United Arab E… 77.8 28.9 16.3 ## 3 AF Afghanistan 64.5 NA 9.2 ## 4 AG Antigua and B… 76.9 NA 13.1 ## 5 AL Albania 78.9 28.7 9 ## 6 AM Armenia 74.9 24.1 6.1 ## 7 AO Angola 60.8 NA 4.5 ## 8 AR Argentina 76.5 21.8 5.9 ## 9 AT Austria 81.8 29.6 6.6 ## 10 AU Australia 82.7 14.7 5.6 ## # … with 200 more rows, and 10 more variables: infant_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # adult_male_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, adult_female_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pollution_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, comorbidity_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # hospital_beds_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, nurses_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # physicians_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, health_expenditure_usd &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # out_of_pocket_health_expenditure_usd &lt;dbl&gt; State-level table: ## # A tibble: 53 × 2 ## location_key life_expectancy ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 US_AK 78 ## 2 US_AL 75.1 ## 3 US_AR 75.6 ## 4 US_AZ 78.7 ## 5 US_CA 80.8 ## 6 US_CO 80 ## 7 US_CT 80.4 ## 8 US_DE 77.8 ## 9 US_FL 78.9 ## 10 US_GA 77.2 ## # … with 43 more rows 3.5 Mobility Table Only state-level information are available in the raw data. After cleaning the data and select only the valid state code, we generate a table of 33762 rows and 8 columns.

So we separated them into two tables. Moreover, we found out that country-level records do no have information about vaccine of different providers (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen), so we remove these columns from the country-level table. ## # A tibble: 34,202 × 7 ## date location_key country_name new_persons_vaccinated cumulative_perso… ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-01-25 AD Andorra NA 576 ## 2 2021-02-01 AD Andorra 460 1036 ## 3 2021-02-10 AD Andorra 255 1291 ## 4 2021-02-12 AD Andorra 331 1622 ## 5 2021-02-19 AD Andorra 519 2141 ## 6 2021-02-24 AD Andorra 249 2390 ## 7 2021-02-26 AD Andorra 0 NA ## 8 2021-03-08 AD Andorra 49 2439 ## 9 2021-03-10 AD Andorra 1211 3650 ## 10 2021-03-15 AD Andorra 3448 7098 ## # … with 34,192 more rows, and 2 more variables: ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 18,471 × 13 ## date location_key state_name new_persons_vaccinated cumulative_persons… ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-01-12 US_AK Alaska NA 22486 ## 2 2021-01-13 US_AK Alaska 2055 24541 ## 3 2021-01-14 US_AK Alaska 10967 35508 ## 4 2021-01-15 US_AK Alaska 4038 39546 ## 5 2021-01-19 US_AK Alaska 15888 55434 ## 6 2021-01-20 US_AK Alaska 1477 56911 ## 7 2021-01-21 US_AK Alaska 2538 59449 ## 8 2021-01-22 US_AK Alaska 7813 67262 ## 9 2021-01-23 US_AK Alaska 5752 73014 ## 10 2021-01-24 US_AK Alaska 4911 77925 ## # … with 18,461 more rows, and 8 more variables: ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_pfizer &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated_pfizer &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_moderna &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated_moderna &lt;dbl&gt;, … "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Country-level Epidemiology Table 4.2 State-level Epidemiology Table", " Chapter 4 Missing values As the epidemiology table is our main focus, we perform a missing value analysis on both the country-level and state-level of this table. 4.1 Country-level Epidemiology Table Among the 163609 rows and 6 columns of the data, a total of 1290 values were missed in 5 columns which are location_key, new_deceased, cumulative_deceased, new_confirmed, cumulative_confirmed. Table 4.1: Missing values of Country-level Epidemiology Table column count location_key 708 new_deceased 203 cumulative_deceased 202 new_confirmed 89 cumulative_confirmed 88 From the missing pattern visualization, we notice that there are a total of 7 missing patterns (excluding complete cases) from over 160000 rows of data with 6 features. The plot in the middle shows all the missing patterns. The plot on the top shows the corresponding frequencies of each patterns while the plot on the right shows the corresponding frequencies of each variables. The majority (~80%) of the missing patterns lacks data in the location_key column, which makes these data invalid as location_key is the main id of our data. Without location_key, we are not able to know where the data is being recorded, and thus the data will be useless in our analysis. The rest of the missing patterns has very minimal occurrences and could be discarded for now in the analysis. 4.2 State-level Epidemiology Table Different from the country-level table, the state-level table is very clean. Among the 38537 rows and 6 columns of the data, a total of 9 values were missed in 2 columns which are cumulative_deceased, cumulative_confirmed. It is possible that the US government has put a great effort on keeping track of the epidemiology statistics. Moreover, as the missing values are all cumulative counts, we can infer these values from the counts of new cases.

We would like to investigate key characteristics for each country, and look at if there exists any correlation to the impact of COVID on the country or if they reflects the effectiveness of controlling the spread of COVID within the country. 5.1.1 Country selection based on Economics and Health Indicators In this section, we want to look at key economics and health indicators in order to select countries that are representative to our analysis on a case-by-case basis. We first begin with the relationship between economic indicators such as GDP (domestic production capability by country) and GDP per capita (domestic production capability normalized by the population). From the scatter plot of GDP vs. GDP per capita, we seperated the graph by two bolded grey lines, which are the mean GDP and mean GDP per capita values across all countries in our dataset. Furthermore, we identified four distinct groups, as indicated in the legend at the bottom of the graph. Countries colored in black are normal or below average countries in both measurements. Countries colored in orange have high GDP (total domestic production), but low GDP per capita (averaged by population). Representative examples include India and China. Countries colored in green have low GDP (total domestic production), but high GDP per capita (averaged by population). Representative examples include Monaco, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Countries colored in blue have both high GDP (total domestic production), and high GDP per capita (averaged by population). Representative examples include the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK. We will investigate the representative examples from each category in our further analysis. The next graph looks at the relationship for countries between GDP per capita and health-related indicator such as life expectancy. We chose these two indicators in order to combine the effects from economic and health. Furthermore, we chose GDP per capita and life expectancy since these two variables are both calculated in the per person basis, making the comparison plausible and meaningful. From the scatter plot above, the graph is divided by two bolded grey lines indicating the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita across all countries in the dataset. We labelled two distinct categories which have high index in both measurements and low index in both measurements. Representative countries in the high index group include Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Ireland, China, and Macao. Representative countries in the low index group include Central African Republic, Lesotho, and Chad. We noticed that most countries with high indices are from Europe or East Asia, whereas most countries in the low index group are from Africa. Notice that we dropped the countries with no records of life expectancy recorded, so there could be some missing countries which require further investigation in the future. 5.1.2 Comparison of cumulative confirmed and deceased COVID cases for representative countries Now, let’s look further into the representative countries filtered by the indicators we selected above. First, let’s look at the cumulative confirmed and deceased COVID cases for one representative country from each of the three distinctly colored (non-black) groups from GDP vs. GDP per capita scatter plot. The countries we chose are CN, IN (from high gdp, low per capita), US, JP (from high gdp, high per capita), and MC, LI (from low gdp, high per capita). Each time series record starts from 2020-01-01 and goes until the current date. From the cumulative confirmed plot above, we see that the countries with the most rapid growth and most cases are the USA and India. The USA is among the group of high GDP and high GDP per capita, whereas India is among the group of high GDP and low GDP per capita. Taking population into account, we expected that China would have similar records as these two countries, which is not verified with this graph. Therefore, we expect that government policy might play a more important role than economic conditions alone. From the cumulative deceased plot above, the result is quite similar to the cumulative confirmed plot. The USA and India have the most cumulative deceased cases from 2020-01-01 till this current date. This graph also suggests that economic conditions do not indicate in the effectiveness of controlling the spread of COVID-19. In this part, we will look at countries from each of the 2 distinct groups in the economics and health indicators scatter plot. Specifically, we selected LS, CF (from the group of low index in both GDP per capita and life expectancy), and LU, LI (from the group of high index in both GDP per capita and life expectancy). From the cumulative confirmed plot above, we see that Luxembourg has significantly more cases than the other three, followed by Liechtenstein. These two countries are all from the group with high index in both indicators. Their population are also less than Central African Republic and Lesotho by at least 10 times. This insight is surprising in that the countries with high econ and health conditions, as measured by the indices, are actually outperforming in the number of confirmed cases. Let’s look further into the deceased number for a comparison. From the cumulative deceased plot above, we see that the ranking, in terms of the four countries’ cumulative deceased numbers, have not changed. However, the difference in magnitude of the cumulative deceased between Luxembourg and Liechtenstein decrased compared to the confirmed plot above. This could indicate that among the confirmed cases, there are fewer deceased cases in Luxembourg compared to Liechtenstein, which in a way reflected the superior medical treatments from Luxembourg. 5.1.3 Relationship between health indicators and COVID mortality rate As seen from the previous sections, we compared representative countries filtered by their economic or economic &amp; health conditions. As a result, we notice that health conditions, from the health indicators, provides more insight into the country’s responses to the COVID. More specifically, we noticed that a country’s power of medical treatment can be reflected by the proportion of cumulative deceased over the cumulative confirmed cases. Here we will denote it by the COVID mortality rate. Let’s look at the distributions of key health indicators, and COVID mortality rate (cumulative deceased / cumulative confirmed) acorss all countries at the most recent date (e.g. 2021-12-11). From the above boxplot, we get the distribution of life expectancy acorss all countries in our dataset. Within the box, the interquartile range (IQR) suggests that the majority (middle 50%) of people live until their late 60s to their late 70s, with the entire range from early 50s till late 80s. This plot gives us a general idea of the distribution and porportion of life expectancy. ## # A tibble: 1 × 6 ## location_key date country_name cumulative_confirmed cumulative_deceased ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 YE 2021-12-08 Yemen 10047 1957 ## # … with 1 more variable: mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt; As in the previous section, we noticed that the proportion of cumulative deceased to the cumulative confirmed (denoted as mortality rate) could give us an idea of the treatment for the country on COVID. Therefore, we use the boxplot on the mortality rate (in percentages) to further investigate the distribution. We noticed that the majority (almost 100%) of the countries have mortality rates below 5%, with several exceptions shown as outlier dots in the graph. Interestingly, there is one country whose mortality rate is close to 20%, which is huge given the distribution of all the other countries. The country is Yemen, shown above. By looking at the distribution, we were able to make some important discoveries. Quantile values for mortality rates: ## 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ## 0.0000000 0.8657044 1.4606402 2.3202494 19.4784513 Quantile values for life expectancy: ## 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ## 52.80500 67.66500 74.13100 78.29268 85.41707 Following the boxplots, we computed the quantile values for each distribution, shown explicitly in values for the corresponding boundaries in the boxplots. Now, we can group each variable (mortality rate and life expectancy) into three distinct groups: Low - the value is within the lower 25% in the distribution; Medium - the value is within the middle 50% in the distribution; Top - the value is within the top 25% in the distribution. We can then look at the relationship between groups within each variable using the mosaic plot. From the mosaic plot, we can see several interesting discoveries. Across the countries with non-null mortality rates and life expectancy, the group of countries with medium life expectancy consists of the majority portion of all groups in the mortality rate variable, suggesting their mortality rates have a wide range of variations. The countries in the group with high life expectancy has the least amoung of proportion in the group with high mortality rates. This makes sense intuitively as countries with high life expectancy typically is associated with good medical conditions as well as living conditions. By looking at two economic indicators (GDP and GDP per capita) and one health indicator (life expectancy) both across the entire dataset and also into specific representative countries, we were able to investigate the overall distributions in one or more variables of interests, time-series trends between selective individuals within groups, as well as relationships between groups for multiple variables. We notice that economic conditions have a less noticable association to COVID analysis compared to health indicators. In this project, we only touched upon life expectancy. However, if you would want to look more into different health indicators provided, you can choose your own by looking at our interactive component section, which we provided a visual scatterplot for different health indicators to assist future analysis.Link to the interactive scatterplots 5.2 US State Level Analysis After the global analysis, we would like to focus more on the U.S. and perform state-level analysis on our data. We are interested in the differences in government reacting time and mobility change percentage between democratic states (blue states) and republican states (red states) as well as the popularity of each type of vaccines. We categorized Democratic and Republican states based on this link. 5.2.1 Differences in government reacting time between blue states and red states. We use the number of days it takes for the state government to publish first mitigation policy after the first Covid case is confirmed in the state as a measurement of how fast the government reacts to the pandemic. We extract the date that the first mitigation policy is published (First Mitigation Date) and the date that the first Covid case is confirmed (First Case Date) for each state from our dataset and subtract them to get the variable that indicates the reacting time of the government of each state. We then draw pair barplot to exhibit the difference between the blue states and the red states. The above plot is consist of two parts, a horizontal bar chart for the ten blue states that reacts the slowest and another bar chart for the ten red states that reacts the slowest. The length of bars indicate how many days after the first case of Covid-19 is confirmed in the state that the government publish the first mitigation policy. By making a pair bar chart of blue states and red states side by side, it is clear that blue states react slower than red states in general. To dive deeper into the distribution of the reacting time of blue states and red states, a pair boxplot is presented down below. The pair boxplot provides us a glance into the distribution of the reacting time of blue states and red states. The red boxplot corresponds to the red states and the blue boxplot to the blue states. This plot further confirms our findings that blue states react slower than the red states in general. 5.2.2 Differences in average percentage change of visits to retial and recreation between blue states and red states. Even though the red states react faster than the blue states, it seems that the policies of the blue states are more effective than that of the red states. From the above line plot, it is clear that the average percentage change of visits to retail and recreation of blue states is lower than that of the red states at any time from Febrary 2020 to December 2021. In other words, the amount of visits decreased is larger in blue states than in red states, indicating that people in the blue states regulate their visits more than the people in the red states. 5.2.3 Difference in the popularity of each type of vaccines. From the vaccination table, we generate a quarterly report of the usage of each type of vaccines. The ranking of the popularity of each type of vaccines is consistent across all quarters. Vaccines that are used the most are those produced by Pfizer, followed by those produced by Moderna, and those produced by Janssen are used the least. This finding indicates that vaccines produced by Pfizer are the most popular ones, probably for their effectiveness and reliability.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In terms of our key findings, this project investigated COVID-19 related data in the global scale across countries as well as in the state-level within the United States. When we analyzed country data, we first identified representative countries using economic indicators as well as health indicators. We found that health indicators have a noticable negative correlation to the mortality rate related to COVID, whereas economic indicators did not pose much effect. Specifically, countries with high health indicators (better health and medical conditions) typically have lower COVID mortality rates. In this project, we looked at life expectancy. As we found that health indicators have more effect to COVID mortality rates, we constructed a d3 interactive scatter plot with different health indicators. For future directions, it would be interesting to filter countries based on other health indicators not covered in the project. You could use our interactive graph to select the variable of your interest. For the state-level analysis, we categorized Democratic and Republican states to look at any differences in terms of response time for mitigation after the first confirmed case and effectiveness in mitigation measured by percentage decrease in people mobility in different settings. We found that even though the red states react faster than the blue states, it seems that the policies of the blue states are more effective than that of the red states as indicated by a larger percentage decrease in mobility. We also looked at the popularity of types of vaccination across all states. Among the three types of vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen, Pfizer’s vaccines are the most popular in each quarter of 2021. In terms of limitations of the project, the health indicators for state-level within the USA is lacking. As they are shown to be important in the country-level, it would be interesting to gather more data to look at any differences within the USA. There can also be difference in the relationship, as reflected in a scatter plot, between two of the same health indicators for the state-level vs. the country level. Moreover, it would be beneficial to have the population statistic at the same time as the number of COVID cases. In this way, we can normalize our data by the population for each region to get a more accurate comparison of the effect. Last but not least, there are other data sets within the platform such as hospitalization records, vaccination facility accessibility, etc. which could be used for further analysis.
